Ludum Dare 27
=============

Code repository for the 27th installment of the Ludum Dare competition, with '10 seconds' as its theme.

The game is developed in Haxe, using the OpenFL and HaxePunk libraries. Pixen is used for graphics and BFXR for its sound effects. The levels themselves are developed using the Tiled Map Editor.

In this game you play as an unfortunate bomb disposal robot. You are tasked to safely dispose of a few bombs in a local industrial complex. However, for some reason your breaks have started to malfunction, so you are only able to accelerate and rely on your surroundings to slow down (by blindingly smash into it). On top of that, each bomb has only 10 seconds left until detonation.
